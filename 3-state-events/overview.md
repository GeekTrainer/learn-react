## Summary

Creating an application typically requires working with data which will change while the user interacts with the app. This is typically managed through some form of state and events. We will explore the concepts of state and events, and the tools React provides for management.

## Learning objectives

1. Explore the concepts of state
2. Changing state values
3. Responding to events
4. Using hooks to respond to updates

## Chunk your content into subtasks

Identify the subtasks of *module title*

| Subtask | What part of the introduction scenario does this subtask satisfy? | How will you assess it: **Exercise or Knowledge check**? | Which learning objective(s) does this help meet? | Does the subtask have enough learning content to justify an entire unit? If not, which other subtask will you combine it with? |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Introduce the concept of state | Introducing state | Exercise | Explore concepts of state | Yes |
| Modifying state | Changing state values | Exercise | Changing state values | Yes |
| Working with events | Responding to events | Exercise | Responding to events | Yes |
| Responding to changes in state | Using hooks to respond to updates | Exercise | Using hooks to respond to updates | Yes |

## Outline the units

1. **Overview of state**

    State is a core concept in any application. As values change through user interactions or other events the application must respond; this is done through state. We will explore how to create and manage state in React, and how to handle user events.

1. **Introducing state**

    - Explore the concepts of state
      - Define terms
      - How is state different from props?

1. **Exercise - Adding state to an application**

    1. Clone the starter repository
    2. Add state
    3. Display the values on the page
    4. Launch the application to test the results

1. **Working with user events**

    - Responding to user events
      - Event concepts
      - Creating event handlers
      - Common patterns

1. **Updating state**

    - Updating state
      - Immutability and React
      - Using a function to update state values

1. **Exercise - Adding event handlers and updating state**

    1. Add method to handle clicks
    2. Add code to update state
    3. Save the page to test the results

1. **Using hooks to respond to state value changes**

    - Using hooks to respond to state value changes
      - Introducing the concept of hooks
      - Examining filters

1. **Exercise - Adding hooks**

    1. Add code to register a hook event handler
    2. Update the display to display the updated value
    3. Save the page to test the results

1. **Summary**

    We explored the concepts of state and events. We now have a page which is fully interactive, and capable of responding to updates of data and user events.
