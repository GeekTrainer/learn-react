## Summary

React is the most popular front-end JavaScript framework. It can be used to create both browser based and locally installed applications. React introduces a new syntax called JSX for controlling the user interface. We will explore the core concepts of React, installation, and creating our first project.

## Learning objectives

1. Understand JSX
2. Install React
3. Create a React project
4. Create a React component
5. Work with dynamic data
6. Work with CSS and style

## Chunk your content into subtasks

Identify the subtasks of *module title*

| Subtask | What part of the introduction scenario does this subtask satisfy? | How will you assess it: **Exercise or Knowledge check**? | Which learning objective(s) does this help meet? | Does the subtask have enough learning content to justify an entire unit? If not, which other subtask will you combine it with? |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Understand JSX | Understand JSX | Exercise | Understand JSX | Yes |
| Installing React | Install React | Exercise | Install React | Combined with create project |
| Creating a React project | Create a React project | Exercise | Create a React project | Combined with Install React |
| Creating a React component | Create a React component | Exercise | Create a React component | Yes |
| Adding style | Working with CSS and Style | Exercise | Work with CSS and Style | Yes |
| Work with dynamic data | Work with dynamic data | Exercise | Work with dynamic data | Yes |

## Outline the units

1. **Introduction to React**

    Modern web development is almost always done by using existing frameworks. We explore how React can make it easier to create a browser-based application and the core skills a developer needs to use the framework.

1. **Introduction to JSX**

    - Introduction to JSX
        - The problem JSX solves
        - Overview of the syntax
        - Overview of the build process

1. **Exercise - Create project from starter**

    - Installing React
      - Highlight installation via npm packages
    - Create project
      - Explore an existing starter project
      - Create necessary files

    1. Clone the repository
    2. Install the necessary packages
    3. Explore the project

1. **Exercise - Hello, React**

    - Create project
      - Create the necessary files
      - Add code to create to display information

    1. Create HTML file to host application
    2. Create JSX file to act as root of application
    3. Add the necessary code
    4. Run the site to see the results

1. **Exercise - Create your first component**

    - Create component
      - Explore the concept of a component
      - Create a component
      - Add the appropriate code

    1. Create a component
    2. Add the component to the page
    3. Explore the code
    4. See the results

1. **Exercise - Dynamic data**

    - Work with dynamic data
      - Explore how you can use variables in an application
      - Examine the syntax for placeholders for data

    1. Update the component to add variables
    2. Save the project to see the results

1. **Exercise - Adding style**

    - Working with CSS and Style
      - Explore how CSS works with components

    1. Add CSS to a component
    2. Save the project and see the results

1. **Summary**

    How did you solve the problem in the initial scenario with the knowledge learned in the module?

    We created a starter project, added components, and locally ran the site. We talked about how React can be used to create different types of projects.

1. **Knowledge check**

    What types of questions will test *learning objective*? *[(Knowledge check guidance)](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/learn-docs/docs/id-guidance-knowledge-check)*
