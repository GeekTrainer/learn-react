React components are designed to be reusable units. To enable reuse, components allow for data to be passed into them through properties or `props`.

`props` are read-only values available to a single instance of a component. They can be set programmatically or with the same syntax you use when setting attributes for HTML elements. Unlike normal HTML, `props` are not limited to strings or primitive values; they can be complex objects or arrays.
