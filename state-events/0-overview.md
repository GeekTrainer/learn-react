Making a React application interactive requires the use of state, properties and events. State is information shared throughout the entire application. Properties is information for use in an individual component. Events are actions typically performed by the user, such as clicking on a button. In this module we will explore how to implement state, properties and events in React.

## Objectives

- Add state to an application
- Add event handlers

## Prerequisites

- Knowledge of JavaScript, HTML and CSS
- Basic understanding of React components
- A code editor, such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed locally
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed locally
- The [starter project](#clone-the-project)

## Clone the project

This module uses a starter project. To obtain the starter project, complete the following steps in a command or terminal window to clone the repository and open the starter folder in Visual Studio Code:

```bash
# Windows
git clone https://github.com/GeekTrainer/learn-react
cd learn-react\\code\\state-events\\starter
code .

# macOS or Linux
git clone https://github.com/GeekTrainer/learn-react
cd learn-react/code/state-events/starter
code .
```
