Components are reusable self-contained units, and makeup the core of any React application. Components can have their own properties (or props), which allow you to pass data into a component, making it reusable across different scenarios. You are also able to use complex data beyond strings and primitive types, giving your components even more power.

## Objectives

- Display dynamic data
- Display lists of data
- Add properties (props) to components
- Use objects and complex data types

## Prerequisites

- Knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript
- Basic knowledge of React and React components
- Knowledge of package management with Node.js and `npm`
- Knowledge of Git

### Locally installed software

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)

- [git](https://git-scm.com/)

## Clone the project and open the code in Visual Studio Code

This module uses a starter project.

1. To obtain the starter project, execute the following steps in a command or terminal window to clone the repository and open the starter folder in Visual Studio Code:

    ````bash
    # Windows
    git clone https://github.com/GeekTrainer/learn-react
    cd learn-react\\code\\3-state-events\\starter
    code .

    # macOS or Linux
    git clone https://github.com/GeekTrainer/learn-react
    cd learn-react/code/3-state-events/starter
    code .
    ````

1. Open the integrated terminal inside Visual Studio Code by clicking **View** > **Terminal** (or tapping **Ctl-\`** or **Cmd-\`** on a Mac)
1. Execute the following code in the newly opened terminal inside Visual Studio Code to install the necessary packages and start the development server:

    ```bash
    npm install
    npm start
    ```

1. Your default browser should automatically open. If it doesn't, open your browser and navigate to [http://locahost:8080](http://locahost:8080). The starter page will be displayed.
