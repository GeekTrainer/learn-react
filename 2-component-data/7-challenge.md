You've seen how to create custom components and display content dynamically. Test your skills by adding a new component to display the steps for the recipe. The steps should be displayed as part of an ordered list (`ol`).

The recipe steps are as follows:

1. Add cut potatoes to a pot of heavily salted water
2. Bring pot to a boil
3. Boil the potatoes until fork tender, about 15-20 minutes
4. Strain the potatoes
5. Return potatoes to pot
6. Add butter, cream, salt and pepper to taste
7. Mash potatoes
8. Reseason and add butter and cream as desired
